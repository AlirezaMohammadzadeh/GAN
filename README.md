# GAN Project

## Overview

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with the MNIST dataset. The GAN consists of two main components: the generator and the discriminator. The goal of the GAN is to generate realistic images from random noise and to distinguish between real and fake images.

## Dataset

- **MNIST Dataset:** Contains 60,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing.

## Training

## Objective Functions for GAN

In a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), there are two primary objective functions: one for the Discriminator and one for the Generator.

### Discriminator Objective
The objective function for the Discriminator is to maximize the probability of correctly classifying real and fake samples. This is given by:
\[ \text{Objective}_D = \log(D(x)) + \log(1 - D(G(z))) \]
where:
- \(D(x)\) is the probability that the Discriminator correctly classifies a real sample \(x\).
- \(D(G(z))\) is the probability that the Discriminator correctly classifies a fake sample generated by the Generator \(G\) from a random input \(z\).

### Generator Objective
The objective function for the Generator is to maximize the probability that the Discriminator classifies the fake samples as real. This is given by:
\[ \text{Objective}_G = \log(D(G(z))) \]
where:
- \(D(G(z))\) is the probability that the Discriminator classifies the fake sample \(G(z)\) as real.

These objective functions guide the training of the GAN by updating the weights of the Discriminator and Generator to improve their performance in distinguishing real from fake data and generating realistic data, respectively.
